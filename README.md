# Web Stats

An application to provide data about urls visited.

## Goal

Come up with a Ruby on Rails application, using Sequel as its ORM, and that allows its users to access two distinct reports, in the realm of web stats, via a REST API:

1. Number of page views per URL, grouped by day, for the past 5 days;

2. Top 5 referrers for the top 10 URLs grouped by day, for the past 5 days.
